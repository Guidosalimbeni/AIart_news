The most exciting news appears to be that Pentagram, one of the world's leading design agencies, has boldly embraced AI art by incorporating Midjourney into their new website design, potentially setting an influential precedent for how established creative institutions integrate AI tools into professional work.

## Latest in AI Art

### AI art is passing Turing tests. Don't let it fool you, too
The article appears to examine the increasing sophistication of AI-generated art and its ability to pass Turing tests (being indistinguishable from human-made art), as analyzed by digital culture expert Lev Manovich. This suggests important discussions around authenticity, creativity, and the blurring lines between human and AI artistic expression, but without the full article, I cannot specify particular artworks, techniques or exhibitions mentioned.

### AI in Art: Everything You Should Know About Its Role and Future - Unite.AI
The article appears to be an introductory overview piece about AI's role in art, framed through the lens of creativity and intelligence.

### How one LSUS art professor is adapting to the use of AI in art
The article appears to explore an LSUS art professor's perspective and adaptation to AI in art education and practice.

### Bring Me the Horizon Facing Backlash Over AI-Generated Art + Visuals
The article appears to reference the metal band Bring Me the Horizon using AI-generated visuals in their live performances, which has sparked controversy among fans. However, the available content is extremely limited and lacks specific details about the actual AI artworks, tools used, artistic intent, or specific fan criticisms. Without access to descriptions of the actual visuals, creative process, or AI techniques employed, it's difficult to provide meaningful analysis of the artistic and cultural implications. This seems to be more of a headline about fan reaction than an in-depth exploration of AI art applications in live music performances.
