### How to Create AI Art: Easy Guides
This appears to be a basic introductory article focused on AI art creation tools, specifically mentioning PicLumen, rather than providing substantial artistic analysis or cultural commentary. The article lacks specific examples of AI artworks, named artists, exhibition details, or in-depth technical discussions. It seems to be a general how-to guide aimed at beginners rather than a piece examining artistic developments or cultural implications. Without access to detailed creative techniques or artistic case studies, it's difficult to evaluate its contribution to the AI art discourse beyond basic tool awareness.

### Grinch Steals Christmas at Fort Wilderness, Disneyland's Use of AI Art Raises Eyebrows & More: Daily Recap (12/24/24) - WDW News Today
Based on the limited content provided, this article only briefly mentions Disney's use of AI artwork in a store at Disneyland, without providing specific details about the artworks, artists, or AI techniques involved. The mention appears to be more of a controversy report rather than an in-depth analysis of AI art implementation. Without more specific information about the nature of the AI artworks, their creation process, or their intended purpose in the Disney store, it's difficult to assess the artistic and curatorial significance. The article seems to focus more on general Disney park news rather than providing meaningful insights into AI art developments.
