### Wakanyi Hoffman’s Post
Wakanyi Hoffman shares insights from her keynote speech at a conference in Bangkok about integrating indigenous knowledge with AI in humanitarian action.

Organizations mentioned include Start Network, Inclusive AI Lab, Utrecht University Centre for Global Challenges (UGlobe), Humanity Link, Seeds of Wisdom, and Grassroots Economics.

### Eduardo Ordax’s Post
The post humorously critiques misleading terminology in the tech industry, particularly around AI and related roles. The author points out that common job titles and terms (Data Scientist, Prompt Engineer, Solution Architect, Artificial Intelligence, AI Agents, OpenAI) don't literally reflect their actual meaning or function. While noting this naming inconsistency, the author maintains that AI itself isn't fraudulent, just poorly named. The post uses emojis and a light tone to make its point about the gap between technical terminology and literal meanings in the field. #AI #GenAI #data #ml
