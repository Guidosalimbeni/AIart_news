When I first found FastAPI, I got it immediately. I was excited to find something so innovative and ergonomic built on Pydantic.
Virtually every Agent Framework and LLM library in Python uses Pydantic, but when we began to use LLMs in Pydantic Logfire, I couldn't find anything that gave me the same feeling.
PydanticAI is a Python Agent Framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade applications with Generative AI.
Why use PydanticAI
Built by the team behind Pydantic (the validation layer of the OpenAI SDK, the Anthropic SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, Transformers, CrewAI, Instructor and many more)
Model-agnostic — currently OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and Groq are supported, Anthropic is coming soon. And there is a simple interface to implement support for other models.
Type-safe
Control flow and agent composition is done with vanilla Python, allowing you to make use of the same Python development best practices you'd use in any other (non-AI) project
Structured response validation with Pydantic
Streamed responses, including validation of streamed structured responses with Pydantic
Novel, type-safe dependency injection system, useful for testing and eval-driven iterative development
Logfire integration for debugging and monitoring the performance and general behavior of your LLM-powered application
In Beta
PydanticAI is in early beta, the API is still subject to change and there's a lot more to do. Feedback is very welcome!
Hello World Example
Here's a minimal example of PydanticAI:
hello_world.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(  
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    system_prompt='Be concise, reply with one sentence.',  
)

result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')  
print(result.data)
"""
The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.
"""


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
Not very interesting yet, but we can easily add "tools", dynamic system prompts, and structured responses to build more powerful agents.
Tools & Dependency Injection Example
Here is a concise example using PydanticAI to build a support agent for a bank:
bank_support.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

from bank_database import DatabaseConn


@dataclass
class SupportDependencies:  
    customer_id: int
    db: DatabaseConn  


class SupportResult(BaseModel):  
    support_advice: str = Field(description='Advice returned to the customer')
    block_card: bool = Field(description="Whether to block the customer's card")
    risk: int = Field(description='Risk level of query', ge=0, le=10)


support_agent = Agent(  
    'openai:gpt-4o',  
    deps_type=SupportDependencies,
    result_type=SupportResult,  
    system_prompt=(  
        'You are a support agent in our bank, give the '
        'customer support and judge the risk level of their query.'
    ),
)


@support_agent.system_prompt  
async def add_customer_name(ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies]) -> str:
    customer_name = await ctx.deps.db.customer_name(id=ctx.deps.customer_id)
    return f"The customer's name is {customer_name!r}"


@support_agent.tool  
async def customer_balance(
    ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies], include_pending: bool
) -> float:
    """Returns the customer's current account balance."""  
    return await ctx.deps.db.customer_balance(
        id=ctx.deps.customer_id,
        include_pending=include_pending,
    )


...  


async def main():
    deps = SupportDependencies(customer_id=123, db=DatabaseConn())
    result = await support_agent.run('What is my balance?', deps=deps)  
    print(result.data)  
    """
    support_advice='Hello John, your current account balance, including pending transactions, is $123.45.' block_card=False risk=1
    """

    result = await support_agent.run('I just lost my card!', deps=deps)
    print(result.data)
    """
    support_advice="I'm sorry to hear that, John. We are temporarily blocking your card to prevent unauthorized transactions." block_card=True risk=8
    """


Complete bank_support.py example
The code included here is incomplete for the sake of brevity (the definition of DatabaseConn is missing); you can find the complete bank_support.py example here.
Instrumentation with Pydantic Logfire
To understand the flow of the above runs, we can watch the agent in action using Pydantic Logfire.
To do this, we need to set up logfire, and add the following to our code:
bank_support_with_logfire.py
...
from bank_database import DatabaseConn



import logfire


logfire.configure()  


logfire.instrument_asyncpg()  


...


That's enough to get the following view of your agent in action:

Installation & Setup
PydanticAI is available on PyPI as pydantic-ai so installation is as simple as:
pip
uv
pip install pydantic-ai


(Requires Python 3.9+)
This installs the pydantic_ai package, core dependencies, and libraries required to use the following LLM APIs:
OpenAI API
Google VertexAI API for Gemini models
Anthropic API
Groq API
Use with Pydantic Logfire
PydanticAI has an excellent (but completely optional) integration with Pydantic Logfire to help you view and understand agent runs.
To use Logfire with PydanticAI, install pydantic-ai or pydantic-ai-slim with the logfire optional group:
pip
uv
pip install 'pydantic-ai[logfire]'


From there, follow the Logfire setup docs to configure Logfire.
Running Examples
We distributes the pydantic_ai_examples directory as a separate PyPI package (pydantic-ai-examples) to make examples extremely easy to customize and run.
To install examples, use the examples optional group:
pip
uv
pip install 'pydantic-ai[examples]'


To run the examples, follow instructions in the examples docs.
Slim Install
If you know which model you're going to use and want to avoid installing superfluous packages, you can use the pydantic-ai-slim package.
If you're using just OpenAIModel, run:
pip
uv
pip install 'pydantic-ai-slim[openai]'


If you're using just GeminiModel (Gemini via the generativelanguage.googleapis.com API) no extra dependencies are required, run:
pip
uv
pip install pydantic-ai-slim


If you're using just VertexAIModel, run:
pip
uv
pip install 'pydantic-ai-slim[vertexai]'


If you're just using Anthropic, run:
pip
uv
pip install 'pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic]'


To use just GroqModel, run:
pip
uv
pip install 'pydantic-ai-slim[groq]'


You can install dependencies for multiple models and use cases, for example:
pip
uv
pip install 'pydantic-ai-slim[openai,vertexai,logfire]'


Model Configuration
To use hosted commercial models, you need to configure your local environment with the appropriate API keys.
OpenAI
To use OpenAI through their main API, go to platform.openai.com and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key.
Environment variable
Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'


You can then use OpenAIModel by name:
openai_model_by_name.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
...


Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:
openai_model_init.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o')
agent = Agent(model)
...


api_key argument
If you don't want to or can't set the environment variable, you can pass it at runtime via the api_key argument:
openai_model_api_key.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o', api_key='your-api-key')
agent = Agent(model)
...


Custom OpenAI Client
OpenAIModel also accepts a custom AsyncOpenAI client via the openai_client parameter, so you can customise the organization, project, base_url etc. as defined in the OpenAI API docs.
You could also use the AsyncAzureOpenAI client to use the Azure OpenAI API.
openai_azure.py
from openai import AsyncAzureOpenAI

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint='...',
    api_version='2024-07-01-preview',
    api_key='your-api-key',
)

model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o', openai_client=client)
agent = Agent(model)
...


Gemini
GeminiModel let's you use the Google's Gemini models through their generativelanguage.googleapis.com API.
GeminiModelName contains a list of available Gemini models that can be used through this interface.
For prototyping only
Google themselves refer to this API as the "hobby" API, I've received 503 responses from it a number of times. The API is easy to use and useful for prototyping and simple demos, but I would not rely on it in production.
If you want to run Gemini models in production, you should use the VertexAI API described below.
To use GeminiModel, go to aistudio.google.com and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key.
Environment variable
Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key


You can then use GeminiModel by name:
gemini_model_by_name.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('gemini-1.5-flash')
...


Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:
gemini_model_init.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel

model = GeminiModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
agent = Agent(model)
...


api_key argument
If you don't want to or can't set the environment variable, you can pass it at runtime via the api_key argument:
gemini_model_api_key.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel

model = GeminiModel('gemini-1.5-flash', api_key='your-api-key')
agent = Agent(model)
...


Gemini via VertexAI
To run Google's Gemini models in production, you should use VertexAIModel which uses the *-aiplatform.googleapis.com API.
GeminiModelName contains a list of available Gemini models that can be used through this interface.
This interface has a number of advantages over generativelanguage.googleapis.com documented above:
The VertexAI API is more reliably and marginally lower latency in our experience.
You can purchase provisioned throughput with VertexAI to guarantee capacity.
If you're running PydanticAI inside GCP, you don't need to set up authentication, it should "just work".
You can decide which region to use, which might be important from a regulatory perspective, and might improve latency.
The big disadvantage is that for local development you may need to create and configure a "service account", which I've found extremely painful to get right in the past.
Whichever way you authenticate, you'll need to have VertexAI enabled in your GCP account.
application default credentials
Luckily if you're running PydanticAI inside GCP, or you have the gcloud CLI installed and configured, you should be able to use VertexAIModel without any additional setup.
To use VertexAIModel, with application default credentials configured (e.g. with gcloud), you can simply use:
vertexai_application_default_credentials.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.vertexai import VertexAIModel

model = VertexAIModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
agent = Agent(model)
...


Internally this uses google.auth.default() from the google-auth package to obtain credentials.
Won't fail until agent.run()
Because google.auth.default() requires network requests and can be slow, it's not run until you call agent.run(). Meaning any configuration or permissions error will only be raised when you try to use the model. To for this check to be run, call await model.agent_model({}, False, None).
You may also need to pass the project_id argument to VertexAIModel if application default credentials don't set a project, if you pass project_id and it conflicts with the project set by application default credentials, an error is raised.
service account
If instead of application default credentials, you want to authenticate with a service account, you'll need to create a service account, add it to your GCP project (note: AFAIK this step is necessary even if you created the service account within the project), give that service account the "Vertex AI Service Agent" role, and download the service account JSON file.
Once you have the JSON file, you can use it thus:
vertexai_service_account.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.vertexai import VertexAIModel

model = VertexAIModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    service_account_file='path/to/service-account.json',
)
agent = Agent(model)
...


Customising region
Whichever way you authenticate, you can specify which region requests will be sent to via the region argument.
Using a region close to your application can improve latency and might be important from a regulatory perspective.
vertexai_region.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.vertexai import VertexAIModel

model = VertexAIModel('gemini-1.5-flash', region='asia-east1')
agent = Agent(model)
...


VertexAiRegion contains a list of available regions.
Anthropic
To use Anthropic through their API, go to console.anthropic.com/settings/keys to generate an API key.
AnthropicModelName contains a list of available Anthropic models.
Environment variable
Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key'


You can then use AnthropicModel by name:
anthropic_model_by_name.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
...


Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:
anthropic_model_init.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel

model = AnthropicModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
agent = Agent(model)
...


api_key argument
If you don't want to or can't set the environment variable, you can pass it at runtime via the api_key argument:
anthropic_model_api_key.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel

model = AnthropicModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest', api_key='your-api-key')
agent = Agent(model)
...


Groq
To use Groq through their API, go to console.groq.com/keys and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key.
GroqModelName contains a list of available Groq models.
Environment variable
Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key'


You can then use GroqModel by name:
groq_model_by_name.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('groq:llama-3.1-70b-versatile')
...


Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:
groq_model_init.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.groq import GroqModel

model = GroqModel('llama-3.1-70b-versatile')
agent = Agent(model)
...


api_key argument
If you don't want to or can't set the environment variable, you can pass it at runtime via the api_key argument:
groq_model_api_key.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.groq import GroqModel

model = GroqModel('llama-3.1-70b-versatile', api_key='your-api-key')
agent = Agent(model)
...


Ollama
To use Ollama, you must first download the Ollama client, and then download a model.
You must also ensure the Ollama server is running when trying to make requests to it. For more information, please see the Ollama documentation
Agents
Introduction
Agents are PydanticAI's primary interface for interacting with LLMs.
In some use cases a single Agent will control an entire application or component, but multiple agents can also interact to embody more complex workflows.
The Agent class has full API documentation, but conceptually you can think of an agent as a container for:
A system prompt — a set of instructions for the LLM written by the developer
One or more retrieval tool — functions that the LLM may call to get information while generating a response
An optional structured result type — the structured datatype the LLM must return at the end of a run
A dependency type constraint — system prompt functions, tools and result validators may all use dependencies when they're run
Agents may optionally also have a default LLM model associated with them; the model to use can also be specified when running the agent
In typing terms, agents are generic in their dependency and result types, e.g., an agent which required dependencies of type Foobar and returned results of type list[str] would have type cAgent[Foobar, list[str]]. In practice, you shouldn't need to care about this, it should just mean your IDE can tell you when you have the right type, and if you choose to use static type checking it should work well with PydanticAI.
Here's a toy example of an agent that simulates a roulette wheel:
roulette_wheel.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

roulette_agent = Agent(  
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=int,
    result_type=bool,
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the `roulette_wheel` function to see if the '
        'customer has won based on the number they provide.'
    ),
)


@roulette_agent.tool
async def roulette_wheel(ctx: RunContext[int], square: int) -> str:  
    """check if the square is a winner"""
    return 'winner' if square == ctx.deps else 'loser'


# Run the agent
success_number = 18  
result = roulette_agent.run_sync('Put my money on square eighteen', deps=success_number)
print(result.data)  
#> True

result = roulette_agent.run_sync('I bet five is the winner', deps=success_number)
print(result.data)
#> False


Agents are designed for reuse, like FastAPI Apps
Agents are intended to be instantiated once (frequently as module globals) and reused throughout your application, similar to a small FastAPI app or an APIRouter.
Running Agents
There are three ways to run an agent:
agent.run() — a coroutine which returns a RunResult containing a completed response
agent.run_sync() — a plain, synchronous function which returns a RunResult containing a completed response (internally, this just calls loop.run_until_complete(self.run()))
agent.run_stream() — a coroutine which returns a StreamedRunResult, which contains methods to stream a response as an async iterable
Here's a simple example demonstrating all three:
run_agent.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

result_sync = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of Italy?')
print(result_sync.data)
#> Rome


async def main():
    result = await agent.run('What is the capital of France?')
    print(result.data)
    #> Paris

    async with agent.run_stream('What is the capital of the UK?') as response:
        print(await response.get_data())
        #> London


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
You can also pass messages from previous runs to continue a conversation or provide context, as described in Messages and Chat History.
jupyter notebooks
If you're running pydantic-ai in a jupyter notebook, you might consider using nest-asyncio to manage conflicts between event loops that occur between jupyter's event loops and pydantic-ai's.
Before you execute any agent runs, do the following:
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

Runs vs. Conversations
An agent run might represent an entire conversation — there's no limit to how many messages can be exchanged in a single run. However, a conversation might also be composed of multiple runs, especially if you need to maintain state between separate interactions or API calls.
Here's an example of a conversation comprised of multiple runs:
conversation_example.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

# First run
result1 = agent.run_sync('Who was Albert Einstein?')
print(result1.data)
#> Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.

# Second run, passing previous messages
result2 = agent.run_sync(
    'What was his most famous equation?',


   message_history=result1.new_messages(),  


)
print(result2.data)
#> Albert Einstein's most famous equation is (E = mc^2).


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
Type safe by design
PydanticAI is designed to work well with static type checkers, like mypy and pyright.
Typing is (somewhat) optional
PydanticAI is designed to make type checking as useful as possible for you if you choose to use it, but you don't have to use types everywhere all the time.
That said, because PydanticAI uses Pydantic, and Pydantic uses type hints as the definition for schema and validation, some types (specifically type hints on parameters to tools, and the result_type arguments to Agent) are used at runtime.
We (the library developers) have messed up if type hints are confusing you more than they're help you, if you find this, please create an issue explaining what's annoying you!
In particular, agents are generic in both the type of their dependencies and the type of results they return, so you can use the type hints to ensure you're using the right types.
Consider the following script with type mistakes:
type_mistakes.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class User:
    name: str


agent = Agent(
    'test',
    deps_type=User,  
    result_type=bool,
)




@agent.system_prompt


def add_user_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:  
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


def foobar(x: bytes) -> None:
    pass


result = agent.run_sync('Does their name start with "A"?', deps=User('Anne'))


foobar(result.data)  


Running mypy on this will give the following output:
➤ uv run mypy type_mistakes.py
type_mistakes.py:18: error: Argument 1 to "system_prompt" of "Agent" has incompatible type "Callable[[RunContext[str]], str]"; expected "Callable[[RunContext[User]], str]"  [arg-type]
type_mistakes.py:28: error: Argument 1 to "foobar" has incompatible type "bool"; expected "bytes"  [arg-type]
Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)


Running pyright would identify the same issues.
System Prompts
System prompts might seem simple at first glance since they're just strings (or sequences of strings that are concatenated), but crafting the right system prompt is key to getting the model to behave as you want.
Generally, system prompts fall into two categories:
Static system prompts: These are known when writing the code and can be defined via the system_prompt parameter of the Agent constructor.
Dynamic system prompts: These depend in some way on context that isn't known until runtime, and should be defined via functions decorated with @agent.system_prompt.
You can add both to a single agent; they're appended in the order they're defined at runtime.
Here's an example using both types of system prompts:
system_prompts.py
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=str,  
    system_prompt="Use the customer's name while replying to them.",  
)


@agent.system_prompt  
def add_the_users_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    return f"The user's named is {ctx.deps}."


@agent.system_prompt
def add_the_date() -> str:  
    return f'The date is {date.today()}.'


result = agent.run_sync('What is the date?', deps='Frank')
print(result.data)
#> Hello Frank, the date today is 2032-01-02.


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
Function Tools
Function tools provide a mechanism for models to retrieve extra information to help them generate a response.
They're useful when it is impractical or impossible to put all the context an agent might need into the system prompt, or when you want to make agents' behavior more deterministic or reliable by deferring some of the logic required to generate a response to another (not necessarily AI-powered) tool.
Function tools vs. RAG
Function tools are basically the "R" of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) — they augment what the model can do by letting it request extra information.
The main semantic difference between PydanticAI Tools and RAG is RAG is synonymous with vector search, while PydanticAI tools are more general-purpose. (Note: we may add support for vector search functionality in the future, particularly an API for generating embeddings. See #58)
There are a number of ways to register tools with an agent:
via the @agent.tool decorator — for tools that need access to the agent context
via the @agent.tool_plain decorator — for tools that do not need access to the agent context
via the tools keyword argument to Agent which can take either plain functions, or instances of Tool
@agent.tool is considered the default decorator since in the majority of cases tools will need access to the agent context.
Here's an example using both:
dice_game.py
import random

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',  
    deps_type=str,  
    system_prompt=(
        "You're a dice game, you should roll the die and see if the number "
        "you get back matches the user's guess. If so, tell them they're a winner. "
        "Use the player's name in the response."
    ),
)


@agent.tool_plain  
def roll_die() -> str:
    """Roll a six-sided die and return the result."""
    return str(random.randint(1, 6))


@agent.tool  
def get_player_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    """Get the player's name."""
    return ctx.deps


dice_result = agent.run_sync('My guess is 4', deps='Anne')  
print(dice_result.data)
#> Congratulations Anne, you guessed correctly! You're a winner!


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
Let's print the messages from that game to see what happened:
dice_game_messages.py
from dice_game import dice_result

print(dice_result.all_messages())

Registering Function Tools via kwarg
As well as using the decorators, we can register tools via the tools argument to the Agent constructor. This is useful when you want to re-use tools, and can also give more fine-grained control over the tools.

    """Get the player's name."""
    return ctx.deps

Function Tools vs. Structured Results
As the name suggests, function tools use the model's "tools" or "functions" API to let the model know what is available to call. Tools or functions are also used to define the schema(s) for structured responses, thus a model might have access to many tools, some of which call function tools while others end the run and return a result.
Function tools and schema
Function parameters are extracted from the function signature, and all parameters except RunContext are used to build the schema for that tool call.
Even better, PydanticAI extracts the docstring from functions and (thanks to griffe) extracts parameter descriptions from the docstring and adds them to the schema.
Griffe supports extracting parameter descriptions from google, numpy and sphinx style docstrings, and PydanticAI will infer the format to use based on the docstring. We plan to add support in the future to explicitly set the style to use, and warn/error if not all parameters are documented; see #59.
To demonstrate a tool's schema, here we use FunctionModel to print the schema a model would receive:

The return type of tool can be anything which Pydantic can serialize to JSON as some models (e.g. Gemini) support semi-structured return values, some expect text (OpenAI) but seem to be just as good at extracting meaning from the data. If a Python object is returned and the model expects a string, the value will be serialized to JSON.
If a tool has a single parameter that can be represented as an object in JSON schema (e.g. dataclass, TypedDict, pydantic model), the schema for the tool is simplified to be just that object.
Here's an example, we use TestModel.agent_model_function_tools to inspect the tool schema that would be passed to the model.

Dynamic Function tools
Tools can optionally be defined with another function: prepare, which is called at each step of a run to customize the definition of the tool passed to the model, or omit the tool completely from that step.
A prepare method can be registered via the prepare kwarg to any of the tool registration mechanisms:
@agent.tool decorator
@agent.tool_plain decorator
Tool dataclass
The prepare method, should be of type ToolPrepareFunc, a function which takes RunContext and a pre-built ToolDefinition, and should either return that ToolDefinition with or without modifying it, return a new ToolDefinition, or return None to indicate this tools should not be registered for that step.
Here's a simple prepare method that only includes the tool if the value of the dependency is 42.
As with the previous example, we use TestModel to demonstrate the behavior without calling a real model.
tool_only_if_42.py
from typing import Union

Reflection and self-correction
Validation errors from both function tool parameter validation and structured result validation can be passed back to the model with a request to retry.
You can also raise ModelRetry from within a tool or result validator function to tell the model it should retry generating a response.
The default retry count is 1 but can be altered for the entire agent, a specific tool, or a result validator.
You can access the current retry count from within a tool or result validator via ctx.retry.
Here's an example:
tool_retry.py
from fake_database import DatabaseConn
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext, ModelRetry


class ChatResult(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    message: str

"""


Model errors
If models behave unexpectedly (e.g., the retry limit is exceeded, or their API returns 503), agent runs will raise UnexpectedModelBehavior.
In these cases, agent.last_run_messages can be used to access the messages exchanged during the run to help diagnose the issue.

1. Define a tool that will raise ModelRetry repeatedly in this case.

Dependencies
PydanticAI uses a dependency injection system to provide data and services to your agent's system prompts, tools and result validators.
Matching PydanticAI's design philosophy, our dependency system tries to use existing best practice in Python development rather than inventing esoteric "magic", this should make dependencies type-safe, understandable easier to test and ultimately easier to deploy in production.
Defining Dependencies
Dependencies can be any python type. While in simple cases you might be able to pass a single object as a dependency (e.g. an HTTP connection), dataclasses are generally a convenient container when your dependencies included multiple objects.
Here's an example of defining an agent that requires dependencies.
(Note: dependencies aren't actually used in this example, see Accessing Dependencies below)
unused_dependencies.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent


@dataclass
class MyDeps:  
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,  
)


async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await agent.run(
            'Tell me a joke.',
            deps=deps,  
        )
        print(result.data)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
Accessing Dependencies
Dependencies are accessed through the RunContext type, this should be the first parameter of system prompt functions etc.
system_prompt_dependencies.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,
)




@agent.system_prompt  


async def get_system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps]) -> str:  


   response = await ctx.deps.http_client.get(  


       'https://example.com',


       headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ctx.deps.api_key}'},  


   )


   response.raise_for_status()


   return f'Prompt: {response.text}'




async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await agent.run('Tell me a joke.', deps=deps)
        print(result.data)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

Asynchronous vs. Synchronous dependencies
System prompt functions, function tools and result validators are all run in the async context of an agent run.
If these functions are not coroutines (e.g. async def) they are called with run_in_executor in a thread pool, it's therefore marginally preferable to use async methods where dependencies perform IO, although synchronous dependencies should work fine too.
run vs. run_sync and Asynchronous vs. Synchronous dependencies
Whether you use synchronous or asynchronous dependencies, is completely independent of whether you use run or run_sync — run_sync is just a wrapper around run and agents are always run in an async context.
Here's the same example as above, but with a synchronous dependency:
sync_dependencies.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.Client  


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,
)


@agent.system_prompt
def get_system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps]) -> str:  
    response = ctx.deps.http_client.get(
        'https://example.com', headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ctx.deps.api_key}'}
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return f'Prompt: {response.text}'


async def main():
    deps = MyDeps('foobar', httpx.Client())
    result = await agent.run(
        'Tell me a joke.',
        deps=deps,
    )
    print(result.data)

Overriding Dependencies
When testing agents, it's useful to be able to customise dependencies.
While this can sometimes be done by calling the agent directly within unit tests, we can also override dependencies while calling application code which in turn calls the agent.
This is done via the override method on the agent.
joke_app.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient

        response = await self.http_client.get('https://example.com')
        response.raise_for_status()
        return f'Prompt: {response.text}'


joke_agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', deps_type=MyDeps)


@joke_agent.system_prompt
async def get_system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps]) -> str:
    return await ctx.deps.system_prompt_factory()  


async def application_code(prompt: str) -> str:  
    ...
    ...
    # now deep within application code we call our agent
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        app_deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await joke_agent.run(prompt, deps=app_deps)  
    return result.data


test_joke_app.py
from joke_app import MyDeps, application_code, joke_agent


class TestMyDeps(MyDeps):  
    async def system_prompt_factory(self) -> str:
        return 'test prompt'


async def test_application_code():


   test_deps = TestMyDeps('test_key', None)  


   with joke_agent.override(deps=test_deps):  


       joke = await application_code('Tell me a joke.')  


   assert joke.startswith('Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal?')


Agents as dependencies of other Agents
Since dependencies can be any python type, and agents are just python objects, agents can be dependencies of other agents.
agents_as_dependencies.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    factory_agent: Agent[None, list[str]]


joke_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the "joke_factory" to generate some jokes, then choose the best. '
        'You must return just a single joke.'
    ),
)

factory_agent = Agent('gemini-1.5-pro', result_type=list[str])


@joke_agent.tool
async def joke_factory(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps], count: int) -> str:
    r = await ctx.deps.factory_agent.run(f'Please generate {count} jokes.')
    return '\n'.join(r.data)


result = joke_agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.', deps=MyDeps(factory_agent))
print(result.data)
#> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.


Results
Results are the final values returned from running an agent. The result values are wrapped in RunResult and StreamedRunResult so you can access other data like cost of the run and message history
Both RunResult and StreamedRunResult are generic in the data they wrap, so typing information about the data returned by the agent is preserved.
olympics.py
from pydantic import BaseModel


from pydantic_ai import Agent




class CityLocation(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str




agent = Agent('gemini-1.5-flash', result_type=CityLocation)
result = agent.run_sync('Where were the olympics held in 2012?')
print(result.data)
#> city='London' country='United Kingdom'
print(result.cost())
#> Cost(request_tokens=57, response_tokens=8, total_tokens=65, details=None)


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
Runs end when either a plain text response is received or the model calls a tool associated with one of the structured result types. We will add limits to make sure a run doesn't go on indefinitely, see #70.
Result data
When the result type is str, or a union including str, plain text responses are enabled on the model, and the raw text response from the model is used as the response data.
If the result type is a union with multiple members (after remove str from the members), each member is registered as a separate tool with the model in order to reduce the complexity of the tool schemas and maximise the changes a model will respond correctly.
If the result type schema is not of type "object", the result type is wrapped in a single element object, so the schema of all tools registered with the model are object schemas.
Structured results (like tools) use Pydantic to build the JSON schema used for the tool, and to validate the data returned by the model.
Bring on PEP-747
Until PEP-747 "Annotating Type Forms" lands, unions are not valid as types in Python.
When creating the agent we need to # type: ignore the result_type argument, and add a type hint to tell type checkers about the type of the agent.
Here's an example of returning either text or a structured value
box_or_error.py
from typing import Union


from pydantic import BaseModel


from pydantic_ai import Agent




class Box(BaseModel):
    width: int
    height: int
    depth: int
    units: str




agent: Agent[None, Union[Box, str]] = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    result_type=Union[Box, str],  # type: ignore
    system_prompt=(
        "Extract me the dimensions of a box, "
        "if you can't extract all data, ask the user to try again."
    ),
)


result = agent.run_sync('The box is 10x20x30')
print(result.data)
#> Please provide the units for the dimensions (e.g., cm, in, m).


result = agent.run_sync('The box is 10x20x30 cm')
print(result.data)
#> width=10 height=20 depth=30 units='cm'

Here's an example of using a union return type which registered multiple tools, and wraps non-object schemas in an object:
colors_or_sizes.py
from typing import Union


from pydantic_ai import Agent


agent: Agent[None, Union[list[str], list[int]]] = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    result_type=Union[list[str], list[int]],  # type: ignore
    system_prompt='Extract either colors or sizes from the shapes provided.',
)


result = agent.run_sync('red square, blue circle, green triangle')
print(result.data)
#> ['red', 'blue', 'green']


result = agent.run_sync('square size 10, circle size 20, triangle size 30')
print(result.data)
#> [10, 20, 30]

Result validators functions
Some validation is inconvenient or impossible to do in Pydantic validators, in particular when the validation requires IO and is asynchronous. PydanticAI provides a way to add validation functions via the agent.result_validator decorator.
Here's a simplified variant of the SQL Generation example:
sql_gen.py
from typing import Union


from fake_database import DatabaseConn, QueryError
from pydantic import BaseModel


from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext, ModelRetry




class Success(BaseModel):
    sql_query: str




class InvalidRequest(BaseModel):
    error_message: str




Response = Union[Success, InvalidRequest]
agent: Agent[DatabaseConn, Response] = Agent(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    result_type=Response,  # type: ignore
    deps_type=DatabaseConn,
    system_prompt='Generate PostgreSQL flavored SQL queries based on user input.',
)




@agent.result_validator
async def validate_result(ctx: RunContext[DatabaseConn], result: Response) -> Response:
    if isinstance(result, InvalidRequest):
        return result
    try:
        await ctx.deps.execute(f'EXPLAIN {result.sql_query}')
    except QueryError as e:
        raise ModelRetry(f'Invalid query: {e}') from e
    else:
        return result




result = agent.run_sync(
    'get me uses who were last active yesterday.', deps=DatabaseConn()
)
print(result.data)
#> sql_query='SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_active::date = today() - interval 1 day'

Streamed Results
There two main challenges with streamed results:
Validating structured responses before they're complete, this is achieved by "partial validation" which was recently added to Pydantic in pydantic/pydantic#10748.
When receiving a response, we don't know if it's the final response without starting to stream it and peeking at the content. PydanticAI streams just enough of the response to sniff out if it's a tool call or a result, then streams the whole thing and calls tools, or returns the stream as a StreamedRunResult.
Streaming Text
Example of streamed text result:
streamed_hello_world.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent


agent = Agent('gemini-1.5-flash')  




async def main():
    async with agent.run_stream('Where does "hello world" come from?') as result:  
        async for message in result.stream():  
            print(message)
            #> The first known
            #> The first known use of "hello,
            #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in
            #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook
            #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C
            #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
We can also stream text as deltas rather than the entire text in each item:
streamed_delta_hello_world.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent


agent = Agent('gemini-1.5-flash')




async def main():
    async with agent.run_stream('Where does "hello world" come from?') as result:
        async for message in result.stream_text(delta=True):  
            print(message)
            #> The first known
            #> use of "hello,
            #> world" was in
            #> a 1974 textbook
            #> about the C
            #> programming language.


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
Result message not included in messages
The final result message will NOT be added to result messages if you use .stream_text(delta=True), see Messages and chat history for more information.
Streaming Structured Responses
Not all types are supported with partial validation in Pydantic, see pydantic/pydantic#10748, generally for model-like structures it's currently best to use TypeDict.
Here's an example of streaming a use profile as it's built:
streamed_user_profile.py
from datetime import date


from typing_extensions import TypedDict


from pydantic_ai import Agent




class UserProfile(TypedDict, total=False):
    name: str
    dob: date
    bio: str




agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    result_type=UserProfile,
    system_prompt='Extract a user profile from the input',
)




async def main():
    user_input = 'My name is Ben, I was born on January 28th 1990, I like the chain the dog and the pyramid.'
    async with agent.run_stream(user_input) as result:
        async for profile in result.stream():
            print(profile)
            #> {'name': 'Ben'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the '}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the dog and the pyr'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the dog and the pyramid'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the dog and the pyramid'}


(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")
If you want fine-grained control of validation, particularly catching validation errors, you can use the following pattern:
streamed_user_profile.py
from datetime import date


from pydantic import ValidationError
from typing_extensions import TypedDict


from pydantic_ai import Agent




class UserProfile(TypedDict, total=False):
    name: str
    dob: date
    bio: str




agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', result_type=UserProfile)




async def main():
    user_input = 'My name is Ben, I was born on January 28th 1990, I like the chain the dog and the pyramid.'
    async with agent.run_stream(user_input) as result:
        async for message, last in result.stream_structured(debounce_by=0.01):  
            try:
                profile = await result.validate_structured_result(  
                    message,
                    allow_partial=not last,
                )
            except ValidationError:
                continue
            print(profile)
            #> {'name': 'Ben'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the '}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the dog and the pyr'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the dog and the pyramid'}
            #> {'name': 'Ben', 'dob': date(1990, 1, 28), 'bio': 'Likes the chain the dog and the pyramid'}

Messages and chat history
PydanticAI provides access to messages exchanged during an agent run. These messages can be used both to continue a coherent conversation, and to understand how an agent performed.
Accessing Messages from Results
After running an agent, you can access the messages exchanged during that run from the result object.
Both RunResult (returned by Agent.run, Agent.run_sync) and StreamedRunResult (returned by Agent.run_stream) have the following methods:
all_messages(): returns all messages, including messages from prior runs and system prompts. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, all_messages_json().
new_messages(): returns only the messages from the current run, excluding system prompts, this is generally the data you want when you want to use the messages in further runs to continue the conversation. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, new_messages_json().
StreamedRunResult and complete messages
On StreamedRunResult, the messages returned from these methods will only include the final result message once the stream has finished.
E.g. you've awaited one of the following coroutines:
StreamedRunResult.stream()
StreamedRunResult.stream_text()
StreamedRunResult.stream_structured()
StreamedRunResult.get_data()
Note: The final result message will NOT be added to result messages if you use .stream_text(delta=True) since in this case the result content is never built as one string.
Example of accessing methods on a RunResult :
run_result_messages.py
from pydantic_ai import Agent


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')


result = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')

Using Messages as Input for Further Agent Runs
The primary use of message histories in PydanticAI is to maintain context across multiple agent runs.
To use existing messages in a run, pass them to the message_history parameter of Agent.run, Agent.run_sync or Agent.run_stream.
all_messages() vs. new_messages()
PydanticAI will inspect any messages it receives for system prompts.
If any system prompts are found in message_history, new system prompts are not generated, otherwise new system prompts are generated and inserted before message_history in the list of messages used in the run.
Thus you can decide whether you want to use system prompts from a previous run or generate them again by using all_messages() or new_messages().
Reusing messages in a conversation
from pydantic_ai import Agent


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')


result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')

Other ways of using messages
Since messages are defined by simple dataclasses, you can manually create and manipulate, e.g. for testing.
The message format is independent of the model used, so you can use messages in different agents, or the same agent with different models.
from pydantic_ai import Agent


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')


result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')

Testing and Evals
With PydanticAI and LLM integrations in general, there are two distinct kinds of test:
Unit tests — tests of your application code, and whether it's behaving correctly
Evals — tests of the LLM, and how good or bad its responses are
For the most part, these two kinds of tests have pretty separate goals and considerations.
Unit tests
Unit tests for PydanticAI code are just like unit tests for any other Python code.
Because for the most part they're nothing new, we have pretty well established tools and patterns for writing and running these kinds of tests.
Unless you're really sure you know better, you'll probably want to follow roughly this strategy:
Use pytest as your test harness
If you find yourself typing out long assertions, use inline-snapshot
Similarly, dirty-equals can be useful for comparing large data structures
Use TestModel or FunctionModel in place of your actual model to avoid the cost, latency and variability of real LLM calls
Use Agent.override to replace your model inside your application logic
Set ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS=False globally to block any requests from being made to non-test models accidentally
Unit testing with TestModel
The simplest and fastest way to exercise most of your application code is using TestModel, this will (by default) call all tools in the agent, then return either plain text or a structured response depending on the return type of the agent.
TestModel is not magic
The "clever" (but not too clever) part of TestModel is that it will attempt to generate valid structured data for function tools and result types based on the schema of the registered tools.
There's no ML or AI in TestModel, it's just plain old procedural Python code that tries to generate data that satisfies the JSON schema of a tool.
The resulting data won't look pretty or relevant, but it should pass Pydantic's validation in most cases. If you want something more sophisticated, use FunctionModel and write your own data generation logic.
Let's write unit tests for the following application code:
weather_app.py
import asyncio
from datetime import date


from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


from fake_database import DatabaseConn  
from weather_service import WeatherService  


weather_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=WeatherService,
    system_prompt='Providing a weather forecast at the locations the user provides.',
)




@weather_agent.tool
def weather_forecast(
    ctx: RunContext[WeatherService], location: str, forecast_date: date
) -> str:
    if forecast_date < date.today(): 


        return ctx.deps.get_historic_weather(location, forecast_date)
    else:
        return ctx.deps.get_forecast(location, forecast_date)




async def run_weather_forecast(  
    user_prompts: list[tuple[str, int]], conn: DatabaseConn
):
    """Run weather forecast for a list of user prompts and save."""
    async with WeatherService() as weather_service:


        async def run_forecast(prompt: str, user_id: int):
            result = await weather_agent.run(prompt, deps=weather_service)
            await conn.store_forecast(user_id, result.data)


        # run all prompts in parallel
        await asyncio.gather(
            *(run_forecast(prompt, user_id) for (prompt, user_id) in user_prompts)
        )


Here we have a function that takes a list of (user_prompt, user_id) tuples, gets a weather forecast for each prompt, and stores the result in the database.
We want to test this code without having to mock certain objects or modify our code so we can pass test objects in.
Here's how we would write tests using TestModel:
test_weather_app.py

    user_id = 1
    with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):  
        prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2024-11-28?'
        await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)  


    forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
    assert forecast == '{"weather_forecast":"Sunny with a chance of rain"}'  


    assert weather_agent.last_run_messages == [  
        SystemPrompt(

        UserPrompt(

        ),
        ModelStructuredResponse(
            calls=[
                ToolCall(

                        args_dict={

                    tool_call_id=None,
                )
            ],
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
            role='model-structured-response',
        ),
        ToolReturn(
            tool_name='weather_forecast',
            content='Sunny with a chance of rain',
            tool_call_id=None,
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
            role='tool-return',
        ),
        ModelTextResponse(

            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
            role='model-text-response',
        ),
    ]


Unit testing with FunctionModel
The above tests are a great start, but careful readers will notice that the WeatherService.get_forecast is never called since TestModel calls weather_forecast with a date in the past.
To fully exercise weather_forecast, we need to use FunctionModel to customise how the tools is called.
Here's an example of using FunctionModel to test the weather_forecast tool with custom inputs

Overriding model via pytest fixtures
If you're writing lots of tests that all require model to be overridden, you can use pytest fixtures to override the model with TestModel or FunctionModel in a reusable way.
Here's an example of a fixture that overrides the model with TestModel:
tests.py
import pytest
from weather_app import weather_agent


from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel




@pytest.fixture
def override_weather_agent():
    with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):
        yield




async def test_forecast(override_weather_agent: None):
    ...
    # test code here


Evals
"Evals" refers to evaluating a models performance for a specific application.
Warning
Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.
Evals are generally more like benchmarks than unit tests, they never "pass" although they do "fail"; you care mostly about how they change over time.
Since evals need to be run against the real model, then can be slow and expensive to run, you generally won't want to run them in CI for every commit.
Measuring performance
The hardest part of evals is measuring how well the model has performed.
In some cases (e.g. an agent to generate SQL) there are simple, easy to run tests that can be used to measure performance (e.g. is the SQL valid? Does it return the right results? Does it return just the right results?).
In other cases (e.g. an agent that gives advice on quitting smoking) it can be very hard or impossible to make quantitative measures of performance — in the smoking case you'd really need to run a double-blind trial over months, then wait 40 years and observe health outcomes to know if changes to your prompt were an improvement.
There are a few different strategies you can use to measure performance:
End to end, self-contained tests — like the SQL example, we can test the final result of the agent near-instantly
Synthetic self-contained tests — writing unit test style checks that the output is as expected, checks like 'chewing gum' in response, while these checks might seem simplistic they can be helpful, one nice characteristic is that it's easy to tell what's wrong when they fail
LLMs evaluating LLMs — using another models, or even the same model with a different prompt to evaluate the performance of the agent (like when the class marks each other's homework because the teacher has a hangover), while the downsides and complexities of this approach are obvious, some think it can be a useful tool in the right circumstances
Evals in prod — measuring the end results of the agent in production, then creating a quantitative measure of performance, so you can easily measure changes over time as you change the prompt or model used, logfire can be extremely useful in this case since you can write a custom query to measure the performance of your agent
System prompt customization
The system prompt is the developer's primary tool in controlling an agent's behavior, so it's often useful to be able to customise the system prompt and see how performance changes. This is particularly relevant when the system prompt contains a list of examples and you want to understand how changing that list affects the model's performance.
Let's assume we have the following app for running SQL generated from a user prompt (this examples omits a lot of details for brevity, see the SQL gen example for a more complete code):
sql_app.py
import json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union


from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


from fake_database import DatabaseConn




class SqlSystemPrompt:  
    def __init__(
        self, examples: Union[list[dict[str, str]], None] = None, db: str = 'PostgreSQL'
    ):
        if examples is None:
            # if examples aren't provided, load them from file, this is the default
            with Path('examples.json').open('rb') as f:
                self.examples = json.load(f)
        else:
            self.examples = examples


        self.db = db


    def build_prompt(self) -> str:  
        return f"""\
Given the following {self.db} table of records, your job is to
write a SQL query that suits the user's request.


Database schema:
CREATE TABLE records (
  ...
);


{''.join(self.format_example(example) for example in self.examples)}
"""


    @staticmethod
    def format_example(example: dict[str, str]) -> str:  
        return f"""\
<example>
  <request>{example['request']}</request>
  <sql>{example['sql']}</sql>
</example>
"""




sql_agent = Agent(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    deps_type=SqlSystemPrompt,
)




@sql_agent.system_prompt
async def system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[SqlSystemPrompt]) -> str:
    return ctx.deps.build_prompt()




async def user_search(user_prompt: str) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    """Search the database based on the user's prompts."""
    ...  
    result = await sql_agent.run(user_prompt, deps=SqlSystemPrompt())
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    return await conn.execute(result.data)


examples.json looks something like this:
request: show me error records with the tag "foobar"
response: SELECT * FROM records WHERE level = 'error' and 'foobar' = ANY(tags)


examples.json
{
  "examples": [
    {
      "request": "Show me all records",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records;"
    },
    {
      "request": "Show me all records from 2021",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records WHERE date_trunc('year', date) = '2021-01-01';"
    },
    {
      "request": "show me error records with the tag 'foobar'",
      "sql": "SELECT * FROM records WHERE level = 'error' and 'foobar' = ANY(tags);"
    },
    ...
  ]
}


Now we want a way to quantify the success of the SQL generation so we can judge how changes to the agent affect its performance.
We can use Agent.override to replace the system prompt with a custom one that uses a subset of examples, and then run the application code (in this case user_search). We also run the actual SQL from the examples and compare the "correct" result from the example SQL to the SQL generated by the agent. (We compare the results of running the SQL rather than the SQL itself since the SQL might be semantically equivalent but written in a different way).
To get a quantitative measure of performance, we assign points to each run as follows: * -100 points if the generated SQL is invalid * -1 point for each row returned by the agent (so returning lots of results is discouraged) * +5 points for each row returned by the agent that matches the expected result
We use 5-fold cross-validation to judge the performance of the agent using our existing set of examples.
sql_app_evals.py
import json
import statistics
from pathlib import Path
from itertools import chain


from fake_database import DatabaseConn, QueryError
from sql_app import sql_agent, SqlSystemPrompt, user_search




async def main():
    with Path('examples.json').open('rb') as f:
        examples = json.load(f)


    # split examples into 5 folds
    fold_size = len(examples) // 5
    folds = [examples[i : i + fold_size] for i in range(0, len(examples), fold_size)]
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    scores = []


    for i, fold in enumerate(folds, start=1):
        fold_score = 0
        # build all other folds into a list of examples
        other_folds = list(chain(*(f for j, f in enumerate(folds) if j != i)))
        # create a new system prompt with the other fold examples
        system_prompt = SqlSystemPrompt(examples=other_folds)


        # override the system prompt with the new one
        with sql_agent.override(deps=system_prompt):
            for case in fold:
                try:
                    agent_results = await user_search(case['request'])
                except QueryError as e:
                    print(f'Fold {i} {case}: {e}')
                    fold_score -= 100
                else:
                    # get the expected results using the SQL from this case
                    expected_results = await conn.execute(case['sql'])


                agent_ids = [r['id'] for r in agent_results]
                # each returned value has a score of -1
                fold_score -= len(agent_ids)
                expected_ids = {r['id'] for r in expected_results}


                # each return value that matches the expected value has a score of 3
                fold_score += 5 * len(set(agent_ids) & expected_ids)


        scores.append(fold_score)


    overall_score = statistics.mean(scores)
    print(f'Overall score: {overall_score:0.2f}')
    #> Overall score: 12.00


We can then change the prompt, the model, or the examples and see how the score changes over time.

Pydantic Model
Simple example of using PydanticAI to construct a Pydantic model from a text input.
Demonstrates:
structured result_type
Running the Example
With dependencies installed and environment variables set, run:
pip
uv
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model


This examples uses openai:gpt-4o by default, but it works well with other models, e.g. you can run it with Gemini using:
pip
uv
PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro python -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model


(or PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash ...)
Example Code
pydantic_model.py
import os
from typing import cast


import logfire
from pydantic import BaseModel


from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models import KnownModelName


# 'if-token-present' means nothing will be sent (and the example will work) if you don't have logfire configured
logfire.configure(send_to_logfire='if-token-present')




class MyModel(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str




model = cast(KnownModelName, os.getenv('PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL', 'openai:gpt-4o'))
print(f'Using model: {model}')
agent = Agent(model, result_type=MyModel)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    result = agent.run_sync('The windy city in the US of A.')
    print(result.data)
    print(result.cost())
Introduction
Examples
Weather agent
Example of PydanticAI with multiple tools which the LLM needs to call in turn to answer a question.
Demonstrates:
tools
agent dependencies
streaming text responses
In this case the idea is a "weather" agent — the user can ask for the weather in multiple locations, the agent will use the get_lat_lng tool to get the latitude and longitude of the locations, then use the get_weather tool to get the weather for those locations.
Running the Example
To run this example properly, you might want to add two extra API keys (Note if either key is missing, the code will fall back to dummy data, so they're not required):
A weather API key from tomorrow.io set via WEATHER_API_KEY
A geocoding API key from geocode.maps.co set via GEO_API_KEY
With dependencies installed and environment variables set, run:
pip
uv
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.weather_agent
